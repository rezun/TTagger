# TTagger

Full disclosure: This extension was developed using AI.
It uses bootstrap and vanilla JS, because I haven't used any JS framework before and I don't want to create code that I can't fully understand or maintain myself.

## What TTagger Does
TTagger is a Chromium-based browser extension that helps you organize the chaos of a long “Following” list. It lets you add personal tags to the streamers you follow, or star your favorite streamers and notify you when they go live.
With either the quick-access popup or the full-featured dashboard, you can select a tag and see which streamers with that label are live right now.

## Key Things You Can Do
- Create custom color-coded tags and drag them into whatever order makes sense.
- Filter and sort your follow list by name, content, follow date, live status, or star priority.
- Star essential streamers and get optional browser notifications when they start streaming.
- Assign and edit tags right from Twitch streamer pages without leaving the site.
- Switch between light/dark/system themes and localize the UI (English and German available today).
- Export your tag setup to back it up, share it, or move it to another browser profile.

## Where You’ll Use It
- **Dashboard (`app/app.html`)** – the full management surface with filters, tag management, live prioritization, and at-a-glance activity details.
- **Browser action popup (`popup/popup.html`)** – a compact quick-launch view showing starred streamers, live counts per tag, notification toggle, and recent activity.
- **Twitch.tv overlays (`content/*.js`)** – injects a tag drawer and star toggle directly into streamer pages so you can label channels in the context you discover them.
- **Options page (`options/options.html`)** – manage notifications, “open in current tab” behavior, Twitch highlighting, language, debug logging, and import/export/reset workflows.

## Getting Started
1. **Load it in a Chromium-based browser:** open `chrome://extensions` (or the equivalent in Edge/Brave), enable Developer Mode, choose “Load unpacked…”, and select this project root. There’s no build step or dependency install—Manifest V3 support in Chromium is all you need.
2. **Connect Twitch:** open the dashboard or popup and click “Connect Twitch” to authorize. The extension only requests `user:read:follows`.
3. **Create your first tag:** use the “Add Tag” button in the dashboard; choose a name, then assign it to streamers from the grid, popup, or Twitch page overlay.

> Firefox support: Firefox’s Manifest V3 implementation is still evolving. The codebase should port once MV3 service workers stabilize, but the current build is tested on Chromium only.

## Privacy & Safety
- Your Twitch token, follow cache, and live-tracking state stay inside browser storage; nothing is sent to third-party servers beyond Twitch’s official API.
- Tag definitions and preferences sync (via `chrome.storage.sync`) across browsers where you install the extension with the same account.
- Live notifications are optional and respect your “open in current tab” preference; you can switch them off anytime in the popup or options page.
- Debug logs and manual exports are stored locally so you’re in control of what leaves your machine.

## Technical Overview

### High-Level Architecture
- `manifest.json` wires together the action popup, dashboard, options page, background service worker, and Twitch content scripts. It requests `storage`, `identity`, `tabs`, `notifications`, and `alarms`.
- `background/service-worker.js` is the central message router. It coordinates OAuth (`background/oauth.js`), follow caching (`src/background/followCache.js`), tag state mutations (`src/background/tagState.js`), import/export, preference updates, and live-tracking alarms.
- UI surfaces (dashboard, popup, options) are vanilla ES modules that import shared logic from `src/`. Each surface bootstraps localization via `src/util/i18n.js` before rendering.
- Content scripts under `content/` hydrate Twitch pages with tag displays, star toggles, and context menus by reading shared state from extension storage and reacting to updates.

### Data Flow & Runtime Responsibilities
1. **Authentication:** `background/oauth.js` implements the Twitch implicit grant, stores access tokens in `chrome.storage.local`, and exposes status through runtime messaging.
2. **Follow cache:** `src/background/followCache.js` batches Helix calls (`src/api/twitch.js`) to build an enriched follow snapshot (profile, stream metadata, last-seen timestamps). The cache refreshes on demand and every five minutes (`FOLLOW_CACHE_TTL_MS`).
3. **Dashboard payload:** `src/background/payload.js` merges auth, cached follows, tag state, and preferences into a single response for the dashboard and popup.
4. **Tag management:** `src/background/tagState.js` owns tag CRUD, order changes, and streamer assignments. Normalized state is shared with all surfaces and content scripts.
5. **Live tracking & notifications:** `src/background/liveTracking.js` schedules alarms, updates the action badge, pushes optional notifications via `src/util/notifications.js`, and records update metadata for inspection in the options page.
6. **UI rendering:** Dashboard state lives in `src/app/state.js`; `src/app/render.js` memoizes derived data (filters, counts) and produces DOM nodes via helpers in `src/util/components.js`. Popup and options follow a similar pattern with leaner state.

### Storage Layout
- **Local storage (`chrome.storage.local`):** OAuth tokens (`authState`), cached follows (`followCache`), popup snapshots, live-state, update log, and “last seen live” timestamps.
- **Sync storage (`chrome.storage.sync`):** tag definitions (`tagState`) and user preferences (`preferences`), including language overrides, notification toggle, “open in current tab”, and Twitch highlighting setting.
- Storage quota awareness lives in `src/util/storageQuota.js`, which preflights sync writes and returns cleanup suggestions when limits are approached.

### Directory Guide
- `src/api/` – Helix REST helpers (rate-limit aware).
- `src/background/` – cache building, tag state, import/export, live tracking, payload assembly.
- `src/storage/` – typed accessors for extension storage (local + sync).
- `src/ui/` – shared UI primitives (modals, toasts, icons) reused across surfaces.
- `src/util/` – cross-cutting helpers (formatting, i18n, notifications, sorting, constants, extension shims).
- `app/`, `popup/`, `options/` – respective HTML entry points plus their controllers.
- `content/` – Twitch DOM integration scripts and CSS.
- `assets/`, `styles/` – icon set, Bootstrap bundle, and extension-specific styling.
- `_locales/` – localization bundles (English default, German translation maintained in parallel).

### Localization & Accessibility
- Messages are registered under `_locales/<lang>/messages.json`; helpers in `src/util/i18n.js` provide fallbacks and runtime switching.
- UI strings use `data-i18n` attributes in HTML templates; dynamic text resolves through `getMessageStrict`.
- Keyboard and screen-reader affordances (ARIA attributes, focus management) live in the render modules to keep surfaces accessible.

### Development Workflow
1. No build tooling or package install is required—the extension runs directly from source in Chromium.
2. Load the project via the Chromium extension loader for local testing; keep the extension reloaded while iterating.
3. When you’re ready to ship, package it with `zip -r dist/ttagger.zip manifest.json app popup options background src content assets styles`.

### Manual QA Checklist
- **OAuth handshake:** Connect and disconnect a Twitch account; confirm follow cache refreshes afterwards.
- **Dashboard tag CRUD:** Create, rename, recolor, reorder, and delete tags; ensure assignments propagate to popup and Twitch overlays.
- **Popup quick assign:** Toggle notifications, filter by tag, check live counts, and launch streamers with each “open in current tab” mode.
- **Twitch overlays:** Verify tag chips render on streamer pages, update live when assignments change, and clean up when navigating around Twitch.
- **Live notifications:** Star streamers, confirm badge counts and desktop notifications, then stop them by disabling notifications.

### Permission Rationale
- `storage`: save OAuth tokens, cached follows, tags, and preferences in Chrome’s local/sync storage so your setup persists across sessions.
- `identity`: start the Twitch OAuth flow through Chrome identity APIs so you can sign in without embedding secrets.
- `tabs`: open Twitch streams (and optionally reuse an existing tab) when you click a live notification or dashboard action.
- `notifications`: show browser alerts when starred streamers start streaming.
- `alarms`: schedule background refreshes that keep live status, badges, and notifications current.
- `https://id.twitch.tv/*`, `https://api.twitch.tv/*`, `*://www.twitch.tv/*`: call Twitch’s OAuth and Helix APIs, and inject the tag UI only on twitch.tv pages.

### Security Notes
- Twitch client ID lives in `src/config.js`; no secrets are bundled. Redirect URIs must stay in sync with your Twitch Developer settings (`docs/auth.md` covers rotations).
- Error handlers sanitize messages before presenting them to users, and debug logging is opt-in to prevent leaking sensitive session data.
